📖 Overview
Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis Portfolio!

This repository showcases a comprehensive SQL project focused on analyzing a music store database (simulating a platform like Spotify's data structure). The project is structured into Easy, Moderate, Medium, and Advanced queries, demonstrating my ability to extract deep, actionable business insights through structured database querying.

This project highlights my proficiency in using SQL to clean, analyze, and transform raw transactional data into meaningful metrics for business decision-making.
